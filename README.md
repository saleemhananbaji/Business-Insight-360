## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing company in the computer hardware industry, realized that rapid expansion without clear data insights was affecting their profitability. To stay competitive and improve decision-making, they took a strategic step toward data analytics. This project introduced Power BI into their operations, creating a unified dashboard that delivers key insights across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain. The goal was to empower stakeholders with a 360-degree view of business performance and enable smarter, data-driven strategies.

## Problem Statement

After opening a new store in America, AtliQ Hardware faced unexpected losses because their decisions were based on guesses and limited data. Other companies with strong data teams were outperforming them, so AtliQ Hardware realized they needed to start using data analytics to make smarter and faster business decisions.

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing company in the computer hardware industry, realized that rapid expansion without clear data insights was affecting their profitability. To stay competitive and improve decision-making, they took a strategic step toward data analytics. This project introduced Power BI into their operations, creating a unified dashboard that delivers key insights across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain. The goal was to empower stakeholders with a 360-degree view of business performance and enable smarter, data-driven strategies.

## Problem Statement:
